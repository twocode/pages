I took a trip to the United States from 12/20/2013 to 01/03/2014. The trip covered a long distance including central, eastern and western parts of the country. It was an amazing country and a wonderful journey.

I spent two weeks in the United States from 2013 to 2014 :) several weeks ago. It was my first time there and I got a lot of destinations and plans, of which only a small portions were implemented because of the limited time. Anyway, we made a whole cross route of central -> eastern -> western journey, exhausting but really fascinating.

<br />

After landing in *Chicago* O'Hare Airport, we went straight ahead to the car rental company in the airport shuttle and picked a full-sized Nissan SUV from Hertz I had previously reserved online. It wasn't long before I getting used to the navigator and controllability of the car. But we soon got confused by the entrances and back-and-forth turns of the highways because of the late night and foggy weather. We spent more than four hours on the two-hour trip to Purdue University where we settled down in the Hilton Garden Inn.

We met some friends from Purdue and drove back to Chicago on the third day, where we would fly to NYC on the next day. We went to the Michigan Ave. that night and enjoyed a nice dinner in a Japanese Restaurant there. 

*PS. My phone was lost in the pool in IN and all photos taken before NYC was lost.*

I chose a Renaissance hotel at the Times Square for our three-night stay in NYC. It had a good view of the 7th Ave. Just pulling over the curtains could get me the view of the big Mantos poster and the sleepless street.

The Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building was stuck with line-ups that would take more than 2 hours. I don't think it worth to get all packed like suddins in the crowd just to see the famous tourist spots, but there seemed no other interesting there. As a huge fan of **Friends**, I went to Central Park and rode a carriage there. We also went to the Metropolitan Museum. It was an interesting place but it seemed to take like forever to look into every artifact there.

We took an Amtrak train to Boston and stayed beside the Charles River in Liberty Hotel for two nights. The funny part was that the Liberty Hotel was a famous building previously used as a prison. No wonder it looked like a battle field of a prison.... We went to Harvard and MIT. We could not get into the buildings in H because of the Winter break. But MIT was a lot busier and many labs were still running.

It was the worst experience to rent the car from Dollar at LAX after about 8 hours on the plane. The long lines-up, arrogant attitude, no reserved cars available, etc. all pissed me off that night. The malfunctioned navigator circled me an hour on the highway. It was quite late to arrive in the W hotel near UCLA but the mirrors there were all rusty.. We went to Universal Studio, Hollywood, Santa Monica, etc.. It was so nice to take a drive in the wonderful sunshine in LA.

The highlight of the whole trip was the self-drive from LA to San Francisco along the Highway 1 and US101. We picked Pismo Beach as the transfer stop. The trip from LA to Pismo Beach was a  ****OH MY GOODNESS**** unforgettable experience, not because of the beautiful scenary and coastline, but the dangerous drive in the those continuously winding mountain ghats at night. Compared to this drive, the second half from Pismo to SF was also winding and variable, but daylight made everything much easier, tiring but not scareful.

The cities we visited all have their own styles and focuses, but not with big suprises. However, SF was a total different city. Up-and-down streets, mixed-up lines of electrical buses and normal roads, parking on the braes of the slope streets... not to mention the coutry towns and piers. But it was loud and messy. I did not like the city.
