####Summary:

1. Generate instructions that do not have stack pointer as destination register.

2. Added register check codes for threads in RIT multithread cases.

3. Enabled more control flows (interworks, call-returns, loops) and VFP and NEON instructions.


####Details:

#####RIT Multithread Structure:

Current RIT multithread cases work in this structure:

[![codestruct]({{BASE_URL}}/images/20131015/codestruct.png)]({{BASE_URL}}/images/20131015/codestruct.png)

              
#####Instructions do not change SP register:

While every thread shares the same function code, the program will crash if the SP is modified by random codes, as 1. control flows use stacks to keep values; 2. accessible data segment addresses are kept on stack; 3. Data segment addresses are visible to all threads, so indexes should also be kept on the stack to tell which part of memory to access. Xiangyu enabled rit to produce arm/thumb/thumb32/vfp/neon instructions, memory related random instructions (ldr, str, ldm, stm,…) excluded. 

#####Stack model in the shared function:

Currently, control flows use cfgdata[][] to keep loop values; in the future, memory-related will be added to the cases. In both cases, memory addresses should be kept on the stack. However, the stack pointer is randomly changed by push/pop instructions when executing different control flows, which make it difficult to locate the memory addresses. Therefore, alloc one stack for each thread is a implemented as follows:

[![stackmodel]({{BASE_URL}}/images/20131015/stackmodel.png)]({{BASE_URL}}/images/20131015/stackmodel.png)

In this way, all the outside parameters like memory data addresses, variables, function pointers can be passed to the stack allocated by the system(qemu or houdini) following ATPCS; and each thread uses a local stack that **always** stores the pointer to the system allocated stack on the top. Each time a push/pop is called, push/pop the SP first, and push/pop it back. For example, at the end of a Loop flow, whether or not to jump out of the loop is judged in this way:

    mov             r3, r5 ;back up r5
    pop             {r5} ;get SP
    ldr             r2, [r5] ;get cfgdata[cur_thrd]
    add             r4, r2, 32+(4) ;get address of cfgdata[curthrd][32+4]
    ldr             r1, [r4] ;get cfgdata[cur_thrd][32+4]
    add             r1, r1, #7 ;random increase
    str             r1, [r4] ;store back to cfgdata[cur_thrd][32+4]
    push            {r5} ;store sp back
    mov             r5, r3 ;resume r5
    cmp             r1, #208
