description: crazy_linker is a user-land linker for APP itself to load libraries themselves. It provides substitutes for dlfcn.h-providing dlxxx familiy functions like dlopen(), dlsym(), etc. Once APP uses crazy_linker (or other linker framework for self-loading), its behaviors are not accessible to the kernel.
